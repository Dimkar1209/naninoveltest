{playerName} What's happening? Who are you?

@char John.Surprised
John: Wow, you didn't ask such questions before.

@char John.Serious
John: You can call me John. I'm sort of your manager. You're a delivery person for very discreet services. You've just returned from your previous delivery, and I've wiped your memory.
John: You need to go now, the clock is ticking." As he speaks, a girl appears.

{playerName} So, why am I doing this?
John: Because we've been working together for almost two years. It's the only job where you can make good money.

@char John.Angry
John: Now go!
