@printer Dialogue

{playerName}: Talking about me? What's going on here? What was in that package?

John: Jane, what the hell happened? The package was supposed to take care of {playerName}. It was a simple plan!

Jane: I don't know, John. Something went wrong. The package... it didn't work as we thought. And now {playerName} knows too much.

John: {playerName}! You weren't supposed to be here... or anywhere, for that matter.

Jane: Look, {playerName}, it's not what you think. We can explain. Just give us the package, and we can sort this out.

John: No, Jane, don't! {playerName}, don't listen to her. You should give the package to me. I can make things right.
